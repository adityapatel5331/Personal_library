## Getting Started

For this activity I am re submitting the lab 3 in which I have received 6/10. 
Feedback provided for lab3 by marker:- (Good Attempt but the use of JS instead of php is not technically how this would be done if this was CSCI3172 then it would work but in the event of this course not entirely.

Marked by: Dave Chuck / dchuck@dal.ca )

From the provided feedback I think, we just have to correct the mistake and change those by learning from our mmistakes. And the feedback will be working as our rubric and Thus I believe that my work is complete except for the part inw which I have used JS instead of PHP. 

So those part will be updated and rest all will remain same.
