3)Resources Used
Whole lab6 file structure and code for the lab7. Also, there were many new functionalities were added, like sign in and number of visits, logout & welcome back message to the user.

On Index.php the files structured were used as described in the lab6 instructions pdf file. And the index.php file was as light as possible.

On clicking the Sign in button, it will take you to page1.php and now everypage will show welcome Username. 
Next to user name thers is a register button .If the user is new then they will be redirected to register.php for registration.

If they are succesfully registered and passed all the validation requirements then their info will be stored in DB.

Like Signout button is visible ONLY when user is signed in.
