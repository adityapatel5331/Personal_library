3)Resources Used
Whole lab2 file structure and code for the lab5. Also, there were many new functionalities were added, like sign in and number of visits, logout & welcome back message to the user.

On Index.php the files structured were used as described in the lab5 instructions pdf file. And the index.php file was as light as possible.

On clicking the Sign in button, it will take you to page1.php and now everypage will show welcome Username. But still the index will work normally and might not show username as this functionslity were added to page1.php

*NOTE :- Logout button has used the class of Bootstrap and it will be only used when the user is logged in.
Like Signout button is visible ONLY when user is signed in.

Also, some parts of the code were taken from my previous submission namely:-
